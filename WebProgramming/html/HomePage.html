    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text markup language. It is used to create Web pages that can be viewed thru' a browser. html is
    the fundamental thing that needs to be learnt for creating any kind of web content.
    Html is made of tags that are sp instructions to the browser on how the content/text has to be presented. The contents
    of the html will be more on text. Even images that are used in html are refered as text which will specify the location
    of the image. HTML does not have any mechanism to draw the image, it simply displays the image from the specified
    source(File path).
